Using the YouTube series "100 days of code" by Replit as my primary learning resource, I have committed to learning how to program in python. 

I have lost all the projects I have built before the day 44 but starting today,I will be posting all my big projects (by big I mean projects that take a lot of time and effort as they are fairly complicated for a beginer)here, in this repository.

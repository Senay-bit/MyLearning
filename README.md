Using the YouTube series "100 days of code" by Replit as my primary learning resource, I have committed to learning how to program with python. 

I made this decision a little over a month and a half ago but after 2 weeks of study, things came up that affected my ability to continue. I am glad to say however that what needed to be done was done and so I can now focus on completing my learning.

I have lost all the projects I have built before the day I stopped but starting today, at day 44, I will be posting all my projects here, in this repository.
